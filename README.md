## Information

Grade Calculator Project

This project reads a variety of data from csv files to create 4 user named files of stats about the class.
- file containing the initials of failed students
- file containing initials and grades of passed students
- file containing full names and grades of passed students
- file containing highest scoring student, and the highest, median and mean overall grades

The project works with csv files, discerning between segments that contain column titles and those containing data. The data comes in a variety of forms,
such as integer grades, character pass/fail indicators, and string names. Different types of integer grades are calculated to be worth different weights, and
strings are manupulateed as needed. Error handling implemented for incorrect forms of data/file extensions.

The grade weights are as follows:

- 5 quizzes (25%)
- 10 assignments (2%x10)
- 10 lab's attendance (10%)
- 1 midterm exam (15%)
- 1 final exam (30%)
